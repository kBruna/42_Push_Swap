# 42_Push_Swap

42's Project Push Swap

Sorting algorithms project.


Stack A that contains unique negative and/or positive integers.

Stack B is empty.


Available operations:

	- sa (swap a) = Swap the first 2 elements at top of stack A.
	
	- sb (swap b) = Swap the first 2 elements at top of stack B.
	
	- ss = Do sa and sb at the same time.
	
	- pa (push a) = Take the first element at the top of B and put it at the top of A.
	
	- pb (push b) = Take the first element at the top of A and put it at the top of B.
	
	- ra (rotate a) = Shift up all elements of stack A by 1.
	
	- rb (rotate b) = Shift up all elements of stack B by 1.
	
	- rr = ra and rb at the same time.
	
	- rra (reverse rotate a) = Shift down all elements of stack A by 1.
	
	- rrb (reverse rotate b) = Shift down all elements of stack B by 1.
	
	- rrr = rra and rrb at the same time.
